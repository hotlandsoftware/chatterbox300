# chatterbox300
Chatterbox 3.00 was the next version of Chatterbox planned. Alas it wasn't ACTUALLY ever finished, or really started for that matter. But hey, the GUI is cool, so just for that reason I'll release it here. 

Again, Chatterbox 3 was going to be made in VB. This time around though, my plan was for it to be more like an ACTUAL LAN chat software. With file transfers, group chat support, one-on-one conversations, etc. I miiight actually finish it at some point but maybe probably not
